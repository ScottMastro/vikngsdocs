Input
==================================

TODO: intro to this section

TODO: While parsing the file only SNPs will be retained (a single A, T, C, or G in both the REF and ALT columns). Multiallelic sites are specified with comma delimited ALT columns, these variants will also be ignored.

Multisample VCF
---------------

A Variant Call Format (VCF) file is a standard way of storing variant information called from sequencing data. Each row of a VCF file corresponds to a genetic variant (insertion, deletion or SNP) and contains information such as the genomic position of the variant, the confidence in the variant call and many other additional annotations.

A multisample VCF is required as input to perform genetic association tests in vikNGS. A multisample VCF is formatted identically to a single-sample VCF except it contains an extra set of columns corresponding to sample-specific data.

   The general layout of a multisample VCF file.

The first set of lines in a VCF file make up the header and are denoted by *##*. The header includes information about the data source and the computational pipline setting used when creating the VCF file. This information is ignored when reading a file into vikNGS. The last line of the header is denoted with a single *#* and includes the column names in addition to a unique identifier for every sample. The first nine columns must be (tab-delimited, in order) **CHROM**, **POS**, **ID**, **REF**, **ALT**, **QUAL**, **FILTER**, **INFO** and **FORMAT**. Every subsequent value is expected to be a unique sample identifier.

Variant Specific Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first nine columns contain information relevant to the called variants.

The first two required columns (**CHROM**, **POS**) specify the genomic coordinates of the variant. The first base pair of a chromosome is denoted as position 1. **CHROM** is treated as a unique identifier for a chromosome. **POS** is expected to be a positive integer value.

The third column (**ID**) assigns an identifier to each variant.

The forth and fifth columns (**REF**, **ALT**) refer to reference alleles derived from a reference genome and alternative alleles observed in the sequencing data. These columns specify whether the variant is an indel or a SNP. 

The sixth column (**QUAL**) provides a Phred-scaled probability that the called base is correct. This field is ignored and not used by vikNGS.

The seventh column (**FILTER**) Indicates whether or not the variant has passed all of the quality control checks present in the variant calling pipeline that produced the VCF file. The value of this field will be **PASS** if the variant passed all of the filters and will be “.” if no checks were applied.

The eighth column (**INFO**) contains additional variant annotations, delimited by a semicolon. This field is ignored and not used by vikNGS.

The ninth column (**FORMAT**) specifies the ordering of sample-level annotations, delimited by a colon. All subsequent sample-specific columns will provide values for each annotation, placed in the same order and also delimited by a colon. In particular, the ordering of **GT**, **GL**, and **PL** is extracted from this column.

Sample Specific Columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All columns following the **FORMAT** column should correspond to a single sample. The header of each column specifies a unique identifier for each sample. Values in subsequent columns are colon separated and are ordered with respect to the labels in the **FORMAT** column. The following values are extracted for each sample.

**GT** (Genotype): A pair of values specifying the predicted genotype for a specific sample (0/0 homozygous reference, 0/1 heterozygous, 1/1 homozygous alternative).

**GL** (Genotype likelihood): A set of three numbers indicating the log-scaled genotype probability of all three possible genotypes. Each number corresponds to the value for homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternative, respectively.

**PL** (Phred-scaled likelihood): A set of three integers indicating the Phred-scaled probability of all three possible genotypes (homozygous reference, heterozygous, and homozygous alternative). These values are normalized since all the values are relative to the most likely genotype (and are therefore not probabilities).

.. note::
    **GL** and **PL** are both ways of representing genotype probabilities. Both values can be used to derive genotype probabilities but because **PL** is a rounded integer, **GL** is more accurate.

    :math:`genotype\_probability=10^{\textbf{GL}}=10^{-\textbf{PL}/10}`

    :math:`-10\textbf{GL}=\textbf{PL}`
.. note:: 
    Since vikNGS accounts for the uncertainty of genotype calling, the software will attempt to parse the **GL** values from each sample first.
    If **GL** values are missing or are formatted incorrectly, then the **PL** values will be extracted. If parsing of both **GL** and **PL** values fail, the **GT** values will be extracted.
    If all three fail, the variant will be skipped and not included in analysis.
    Note that if **GT** values are indicated as “missing” (ex. ./.) then the variant will be skipped even if values for **GL** and **PL** are present.

Sample Information File
-----------------------

To associate samples with case-control status or qualitative values, vikNGS requires the user to provide information in a separate file. This tab-separated file is defined specifically for use in vikNGS. One line per sample column in the VCF.

The columns are defined as follows:

Sample ID
~~~~~~~~~
The sample ID should be a unique value. The only additional requirement is that every sample ID needs to identically match exactly one of the IDs that appear after the FORMAT column in the multisample VCF file. This column specifies the relationship between the sample-specific data and the data in the VCF file.

Response Variable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This column will determine whether the samples are case-control or qualitative. For case-control, cases are designated with a 1 and controls with a 0 in this column. For qualitative, the actual qualitative value (numeric value) should be provided.

Group ID
~~~~~~~~
Use this column to specify if samples are from different groups or studies. Any samples with the same value in the column will be put in the same group.


Read Depth
~~~~~~~~~~
The ??????????? is calculated differently for high read depth samples versus low read depth sample. In order to determine how to calculate ?????????variance???????, the read depth of each sample must be specified in this column. The actual read depth value from the sequencing run can be provided as or simply a letter specifying whether a sample is from a high or low sequencing run (H = high, L = low). Note that all samples with a shared group ID must also share high/low read depth status. Therefore, the first read depth value encountered for a group will be applied to all members of that group.

Covariates
~~~~~~~~~~
The remaining columns are used to specify covariates. Covariates can either be continuous or categorical. If every value in a covariate column is numeric, the column will be treated as a continuous covariate. If a single non-numeric value is identified, the covariate will be treated as categorical and a new dummy covariate will be made for EVERY unique value (high cardinality categorical variables can result in significantly longer computation time).


BED File (Optional)
-----------------------

Elucidation of associated rare variants can be challenging because the frequency of the associated allele can be extremely low. To improve the power of statistical tests that identify rare alleles, it is necessary to collapse a group of linked variants and perform the association test on a genetic region rather than individual SNPs. For rare variant association in vikiNGS, a collapsing strategy must be specified.

There are four types of collapsing strategies available:
Collapse every k
Collapse by gene
Collapse by coding region
Collapse by exon

By default, the variants will be read and filtered from an input VCF file. After the filtering step, the first kth variants will be collapsed together, followed by the next set of k non-overlapping variants and so on (k=5 by default).

To collapse variants in a more biologically relevant way, a BED file must be provided specifying the collapsible regions. A BED file is a tab-delimited which describes genomic features intended to be used for visualization in a genome browser. The format is specified by UCSC Genome Bioinformatics, detailed information can be found on their web page. Every line describes a single region as follows

The first three columns specify the gene 

1:chrom - The name of the chromosome matching the first column in the VCF file.
2: chromStart - The starting position of the gene on the chromosome (starting from 0)
3: chromEnd - The ending position of the gene on the chromosome. This base is not included in the gene.

For example, to specify the first 250 bases on chromosome 4:
chr4    0    250

The next six column are specified by the BED format but are not used in variant collapsing:

4: name - Optional identifier for this region.
5: score -  Not used.
6: strand - Not used.
7: thickStart - Not used.
8: thickEnd - Not used.
9: itemRgb - Not used.

The last three columns are used if collapsing:

10: blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the gene.
11: blockSizes - The size of each exon, comma separated list the size of blockCount.
12: blockStarts - Positions where each exon should begin, relative to chromStart. Comma separated list the size of blockCount


To collapse variants by gene, the first three columns are required to indicate where each gene begins and ends.

To collapse variants by coding region or by exon, all twelve columns must be present. The coding region is defined to be where the first block/exon starts to where the last one ends. Each exon is specified by a block and variants within that block will be collapsed.
